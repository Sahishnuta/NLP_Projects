## Problem Statement Analysis

Based on the repository structure and common TTS implementations, this project appears to solve the following problem:

### Core Problem Statement:
**"Converting written text into natural-sounding spoken audio to enable accessible, hands-free content consumption and enhance user experience across various applications."**

### Key Sub-Problems Addressed:

1. **Text Processing & Normalization**
   - Handling different text formats, punctuation, and special characters
   - Converting numbers, abbreviations, and symbols to spoken form
   - Managing text segmentation and sentence parsing

2. **Speech Synthesis**
   - Generating human-like speech from processed text
   - Controlling speech parameters (rate, pitch, volume)
   - Supporting multiple languages/voices

3. **Audio Output Management**
   - Creating playable audio files or streams
   - Supporting various output formats (MP3, WAV, etc.)
   - Real-time playback capabilities

### Technical Challenges Solved:

- **Naturalness**: Making synthesized speech sound human-like and natural
- **Intelligibility**: Ensuring clear pronunciation and understanding
- **Performance**: Efficient processing for real-time applications
- **Flexibility**: Supporting different voices, languages, and customization options

### Expected Features:
- Multiple voice options
- Adjustable speech parameters
- File export capabilities
- Support for different languages
- Real-time text-to-speech conversion

### Target Use Cases:
- Accessibility tools for visually impaired users
- Language learning applications
- Audiobook generation
- Voice assistants and chatbots
- Educational content
- Hands-free information consumption

This project likely implements a complete TTS pipeline from text input to audio output, potentially using either rule-based synthesis or machine learning approaches for more natural speech generation.
